# VPN Manager

A NetworkManager VPN front end for Noctalia: connect, disconnect, import and
auto-switch VPN connections of any protocol NetworkManager supports, from a
bar widget and panel, the same way `nm-applet`/`nmtui` do.

## Plugin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | `andrewdems/vpn-manager` |
| Entries | Service: `service`; bar widget: `bar`; panel: `panel`; shortcut: `toggle`; launcher: `provider` |
| Launcher Prefix | `/vpn` |

## Requirements

NetworkManager, providing `nmcli` on `PATH`. Any VPN protocol you want to use
also needs its NetworkManager VPN plugin installed - see **How it works** below.

**Edit connection** opens `nm-connection-editor` when it is installed, and falls
back to `nmtui-edit` in a terminal otherwise. Neither is required: without them
the button just reports that no editor was found.

The file picker used by **Add VPN** is `kdialog`, falling back to `zenity`.
Neither is required either - without them you can still type a path or paste the
configuration text.

## How it works

This plugin does not implement any VPN protocol itself. It drives `nmcli`,
so it supports whatever protocols your installed NetworkManager VPN plugins
support: OpenVPN, WireGuard (built into NetworkManager), IPsec/IKEv2
(strongSwan), L2TP/IPsec, PPTP, SSTP, Cisco AnyConnect (OpenConnect) and
Cisco legacy VPN (vpnc). Any VPN connection already configured with
`nmtui`, `nm-connection-editor` or `nmcli` shows up in the panel
automatically.

Install the matching package to add a protocol, e.g. on Arch:

```sh
sudo pacman -S networkmanager-openvpn      # OpenVPN
sudo pacman -S networkmanager-strongswan   # IPsec / IKEv2
sudo pacman -S networkmanager-l2tp         # L2TP/IPsec
sudo pacman -S networkmanager-pptp         # PPTP
sudo pacman -S networkmanager-openconnect  # Cisco AnyConnect
sudo pacman -S networkmanager-vpnc         # Cisco legacy VPN
sudo pacman -S networkmanager-sstp         # SSTP
```

WireGuard needs nothing extra; NetworkManager 1.16+ supports it natively.

## Usage

Add the **VPN Manager** widget under Settings → Bar (or add
`andrewdems/vpn-manager:bar` to a bar's widget list in `config.toml`), and/or
add the `toggle` shortcut to the control center. Click the bar widget to
open the panel.

In the panel:

- **Connections** - toggle to connect/disconnect, star to mark as the
  auto-connect default, the info button to expand the connection's details, and
  trash to delete (which asks first).
- **Connection details** - expanding an active connection shows its state,
  device, IPv4/IPv6 address and gateway, read live from `nmcli`. An inactive
  connection has none of that yet, so it says so. **Edit connection** opens the
  connection in a full editor.
- **Add VPN** - import a `.ovpn`/WireGuard/vpnc/OpenConnect config. The folder
  button opens a graphical file picker (`kdialog`, or `zenity`) and imports
  whatever you choose; you can also type a path or paste the config text. PPTP,
  L2TP/IPsec and IKEv2 generally need fields typed in rather than a file -
  create those with `nmtui` and they'll appear in the list automatically.

  Opening the picker closes the panel. That is deliberate: the picker is a
  separate window, and a panel left open underneath it holds a layer-shell grab
  that would leave the picker visible but unclickable. The file you choose is
  imported on its own, and appears in the connection list next time you open
  the panel. If the import fails, the panel reopens on this form with the
  reason and the file that failed, so you can pick a protocol explicitly and
  retry.
- **Trusted networks** - list of Wi-Fi SSIDs / Ethernet connection names
  where the VPN should stay off. One-click `Trust '<name>'` buttons appear
  for whatever network you're currently on.

Open or close the panel with:

```sh
noctalia msg panel-toggle andrewdems/vpn-manager:panel
```

Typing `/vpn` in the launcher offers "Open VPN Manager" plus a
connect/disconnect entry for every configured connection.

## Auto-connect on untrusted networks

Turn on **Auto-connect on untrusted networks** in the plugin's settings
(gear icon in the panel, or Settings → Plugins → VPN Manager) and star a
connection to make it the default. Whenever the active Wi-Fi/Ethernet
network isn't on your trusted list for `stable_checks` consecutive polls,
that VPN is connected automatically; when you're back on a trusted network,
it's disconnected automatically (only if this plugin was the one that
started it - a VPN you connected by hand is left alone).

Wired Ethernet is trusted by default (**Treat any wired connection as
trusted**); turn that off if you plug into untrusted wired networks too.

## Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `auto_connect_enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Auto-connect the default VPN on untrusted networks. |
| `auto_disconnect_on_trusted` | `bool` | `true` | Auto-disconnect a plugin-started VPN on trusted networks. |
| `trust_all_ethernet` | `bool` | `true` | Treat any wired connection as trusted. |
| `notify_on_autoswitch` | `bool` | `true` | Notify on automatic connect/disconnect. |
| `poll_interval_seconds` | `int` | `5` | How often to check VPN/network status. |
| `stable_checks` | `int` | `3` | Consecutive checks required before switching (debounce). |

## IPC

```sh
noctalia msg panel-toggle andrewdems/vpn-manager:panel                    # open or close the panel
noctalia msg plugin andrewdems/vpn-manager:service all refresh            # re-poll NetworkManager now
noctalia msg plugin andrewdems/vpn-manager:service all status             # notify with the active VPNs
noctalia msg plugin andrewdems/vpn-manager:service all connect <uuid>     # connect one VPN by UUID
noctalia msg plugin andrewdems/vpn-manager:service all disconnect <uuid>  # disconnect one VPN by UUID
noctalia msg plugin andrewdems/vpn-manager:service all import <path>      # import a config file
noctalia msg plugin andrewdems/vpn-manager:service all pick               # open a file picker and import what is chosen
noctalia msg plugin andrewdems/vpn-manager:service all dismiss-error      # clear a stuck import-failure banner
noctalia msg plugin andrewdems/vpn-manager:service all list               # log the known connections
```

UUIDs are the ones `nmcli connection show` prints.

## Notes

- Secrets (passwords, PSKs) are never touched by this plugin - it only
  passes UUIDs to `nmcli`. A connection whose password is marked *agent-owned*
  (`password-flags = 1`) needs a NetworkManager **secret agent** to supply it;
  without one, NetworkManager reports `No valid secrets` and activation fails
  before the VPN process starts. Desktop environments ship an agent
  (`nm-applet`, GNOME Shell, plasma-nm); a bare Wayland session often has none.

  When a connect fails that way, this plugin reruns it as
  `nmcli --ask connection up uuid <uuid>` in a terminal so you can type the
  password. Auto-connect never does this - it will not seize a terminal
  unprompted - and reports the problem instead.

  To stop being asked at all, store the password in the connection:

  ```sh
  nmcli connection modify <name> vpn.secrets password=<password> vpn.data password-flags=0
  ```

  NetworkManager then keeps it in the connection file (root-readable only) and
  the VPN connects headlessly from then on.
- Pasted/imported config text is written to a temporary file under the
  plugin's data directory only for the duration of the `nmcli connection
  import` call, then deleted immediately (success or failure) so secrets
  don't linger on disk outside NetworkManager's own connection storage.
- Newly imported connections have NetworkManager's own `autoconnect` turned
  off, since this plugin (when enabled) is what decides when the VPN comes
  up, based on trusted networks rather than "device available".
- Trusted networks, the default VPN, and which VPN this plugin auto-started
  are stored under `noctalia.pluginDataDir()`, not in `plugin.toml` settings,
  since they're runtime lists edited from the panel.

This plugin, and this README, were written with AI assistance. I run it on my
own desktop and tested what shipped.
