"""Consent gate hook (lowcache/claude-companion plugin).

Turns a Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook into a desktop approval prompt: the tool call
blocks here while the consent panel asks you about it, and your answer is handed back
to Claude as a permission decision. Invoked from settings.snippet.json as:

    consent.py

Hook JSON arrives on stdin (tool_name, tool_input, tool_use_id, cwd, session_id,
permission_mode). A decision is returned by printing, on stdout:

    {"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
                            "permissionDecision": "allow"|"deny",
                            "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}}

Printing NOTHING means "no decision, proceed normally" — that is the fail-open path,
and every error route in this file takes it. A gate that hangs or crashes must degrade
to exactly the behaviour you had before the plugin was installed.

Three modes, read from the mode file that pulse-svc mirrors the `consent_mode` plugin
setting into (missing file → off, because a shell that is not running cannot answer):

    off      exit immediately; identical to not having the hook installed
    learn    record what came through, never block; seeds the allowlist from real
             traffic so the first ENFORCED session is already quiet
    enforce  block anything not already allowlisted

`permission_mode` is honoured: bypassPermissions and dontAsk are the user telling
Claude Code not to ask, and this hook is not entitled to overrule that.

Forgery: the request/response pair lives in $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (0700, tmpfs, per-user)
and each request carries a nonce the response must echo. Without XDG_RUNTIME_DIR the
gate disables itself rather than fall back to a world-writable /tmp, where any local
process could drop an "allow" of its own.
