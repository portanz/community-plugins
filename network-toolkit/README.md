# Network Toolkit

A unified network management hub for Noctalia providing real-time Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Hotspot, Bluetooth, and persistent DNS control from a single interface.

## Plugin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | `autumn/network-toolkit` |
| Entries | Bar widget: `widget`; shortcut: `toggle`; panel: `panel`; service: `service` |

## Requirements

Install the following tools on `PATH`:

- **`networkmanager`** (`nmcli`) — Wi-Fi scanning, connection management, hotspot orchestration, and DNS routing.
- **`bluez-utils`** (`bluetoothctl`) — Bluetooth adapter power, scanning, device pairing, and trust settings.
- **`ip`** — Interface address resolution and neighbor discovery.
- **`iw`** — Virtual AP interface provisioning (`__ap`) and wireless client enumeration.
- **`qrencode`** *(optional)* — Generates shareable Wi-Fi QR codes in the panel.

## Features

- **Wi-Fi & Ethernet**: Live access point scanning with signal metrics and security badges; inline password authentication prompt; saved network quick-connect; QR code generator for connected Wi-Fi credentials; network forget capability.
- **Concurrent Wi-Fi Hotspot**: Dynamically provisions a virtual access point (`<interface>-ap`, such as `wlp3s0-ap` or `wlan0-ap`) alongside active Wi-Fi station mode on supported hardware via `scripts/hotspot_helper.sh`, allowing you to host a hotspot while remaining connected to your existing Wi-Fi network; live connected client list with hostnames, IP, and MAC addresses.
- **Bluetooth Device Manager**: Built-in native C BlueZ D-Bus agent (`scripts/bluetooth_helper`) delivering instant desktop pairing authorization popups with PIN/passkey validation; one-click connect, disconnect, device removal, and auto-reconnect (trust) configuration; adapter discoverability toggle.
- **Persistent DNS Switcher**: Instant switching between curated providers (Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, AdGuard) and custom DNS servers; automatically re-applies chosen DNS across network switches and system reboots.
- **Bar Widget & Shortcut**: Highly configurable top bar widget supporting single or multi-domain indicator modes; quick-toggle control center shortcut for one-click hotspot activation. The widget also displays a red dot if the hotspot is active and a green dot if a custom DNS is being used.

## Usage

1. Add the `Network Toolkit` widget to your bar in **Settings → Bar Widgets**.
2. Add the `Hotspot` shortcut tile in **Settings → Control Center → Shortcuts**.
3. **Left-click** the bar widget to open the main network panel.
4. **Right-click** the bar widget to trigger the configured quick action (toggle Wi-Fi, Hotspot, or Bluetooth).
5. **Right-click** any section header icon in the panel (Wi-Fi, Hotspot, Bluetooth, DNS) to quickly toggle its power state on or off.

Open the main panel via IPC:

```sh
noctalia msg panel-toggle autumn/network-toolkit:panel
```

Or bind it to a keybinding in your configuration:

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+N { spawn-sh "noctalia msg panel-toggle autumn/network-toolkit:panel"; }
}
```

(Niri configuration example)

## Settings

All settings can be configured under **Settings → Plugins → Network Toolkit**:

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `refreshinterval` | `int` | `5` | Background state refresh interval in seconds (2–60). |
| `color` | `string` | `on_surface_variant` | Theme color token for widget glyphs. |
| `text_color` | `string` | `on_surface_variant` | Theme color token for widget labels. |
| `hotspot_ssid` | `string` | `Noctalia-Hotspot` | Default broadcast SSID for the hotspot. |
| `hotspot_password` | `string` | `noctaliapass` | WPA2 passphrase for the hotspot (minimum 8 characters). |
| `hotspot_max_connections` | `int` | `8` | Maximum client connections allowed on the hotspot (1–32). |
| `custom_dns_1` | `string` | `""` | Custom DNS slot 1 (`Name=IP`, e.g. `NextDNS=45.90.28.0 45.90.30.0`). |
| `custom_dns_2` | `string` | `""` | Custom DNS slot 2. |
| `custom_dns_3` | `string` | `""` | Custom DNS slot 3. |
| `widget_display_mode` | `select` | `network` | Display mode: `network`, `bluetooth`, `dns`, `network_hotspot`, `network_bluetooth`, `network_dns`, `bluetooth_dns`, `network_bluetooth_dns`, `network_hotspot_bluetooth_dns`. |
| `widget_indicator_dots` | `select` | `hotspot_dns` | Status dots shown on widget: `hotspot_dns` (Hotspot + DNS), `hotspot` (Hotspot only), `dns` (DNS only), `none` (Disabled). |
| `widget_right_click` | `select` | `toggle_wifi` | Quick action on right-click: `toggle_wifi`, `toggle_hs`, or `toggle_bt`. |

## IPC

The background service synchronizes state across all entries via `network_command` and `network_state`. You can also trigger panel actions directly:

```sh
# Toggle panel
noctalia msg panel-toggle autumn/network-toolkit:panel

# Open panel
noctalia msg panel-open autumn/network-toolkit:panel

# Close panel
noctalia msg panel-close autumn/network-toolkit:panel
```

## Notes

- **Bluetooth Pairing Agent**: Uses a built-in D-Bus agent (`scripts/bluetooth_helper`) registered under `/org/noctalia/bluetooth_helper` to handle authorization and passkey requests directly with BlueZ.
- **Concurrent Hotspot**: Simultaneous Wi-Fi client and AP mode dynamically creates a virtual interface (`<interface>-ap`) via `scripts/hotspot_helper.sh`. If the wireless driver does not support multi-VIF concurrency, starting the hotspot will fall back to standard access point mode.
- **DNS Configuration**: DNS preferences are managed through NetworkManager device connections and persist across network switches.
- **Files Written**: Runtime pairing and DNS states are stored in `/tmp` during the active session.
