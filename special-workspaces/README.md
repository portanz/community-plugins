# Special Workspaces

Displays populated and currently active Hyprland special workspaces as compact
chips in the Noctalia bar.

## Plugin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | `jamesfeeder/special-workspaces` |
| Entries | Bar widget: `special-workspaces`; service: `workspace-state` |

## Requirements

- Noctalia v5 with plugin API 3 or newer.
- Hyprland, including its `hyprctl` utility.
- Install `socat` on `PATH`.

## Usage

Enable `jamesfeeder/special-workspaces` in **Settings → Plugins**, then add
**Special Workspaces** to the bar from **Settings → Bar**.

The widget shows special workspaces in alphabetical order. Active workspaces
remain visible when empty. Inactive workspaces appear only while populated and
can be hidden with `hide_inactive`.

## Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `font_size` | `int` | `11` | Workspace name font size. Set `0` to use system default. |
| `max_label_chars` | `int` | `0` | Maximum Unicode characters shown from each workspace name. `0` shows the full name. |
| `hide_inactive` | `bool` | `false` | Hide populated workspaces unless they are visible on a monitor. |
| `capsule_radius` | `int` | `8` | Corner radius in logical pixels. Negative values are treated as `0`. |
| `capsule_padding` | `int` | `5` | Space before and after the label along the bar axis, in logical pixels. Negative values are treated as `0`. |
| `capsule_min_width` | `int` | `35` | Minimum capsule length along the bar axis, in logical pixels. Negative values are treated as `0`. |
| `active_style` | `select` | `"fill"` | Active capsule style: `"fill"` or `"ghost"`. |
| `inactive_style` | `select` | `"fill"` | Inactive capsule style: `"fill"` or `"ghost"`. Hidden when `hide_inactive` is enabled. |

## Notes

- Active means visible on any monitor, not focused.
- Fill style uses `primary` colors for active workspaces and `secondary` colors
  for inactive workspaces. Ghost style uses a transparent fill with `primary`
  or `on_surface` text.
- On vertical bars, capsules grow vertically and display one Unicode character
  per line from top to bottom.
- The service snapshots `hyprctl -j clients` and `hyprctl -j monitors`, then
  listens to Hyprland's `.socket2.sock` through `socat`.
- If the event socket disconnects, the service waits for it to return,
  refreshes its snapshot, and reconnects. It retains the last valid state while
  `hyprctl` is unavailable and retries failed snapshots up to twice.
