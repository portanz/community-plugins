# YouTube Music

A YouTube Music client for Noctalia v5 with a bar miniplayer and a full shell
panel — browse your library, playlists, and recommendations, and control
playback with full transport controls, offline caching, and session restore.

## Plugin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | `aabidk20/yt-music` |
| Entries | Bar widget: `widget`; panels: `mini`, `panel`; service: `service` |

## Requirements

Install these tools on your `PATH`:

- `yt-dlp` — stream resolution, audio downloads, and view/like counts
- `mpv` — playback engine
- `mpv-mpris` — MPRIS control of mpv *(optional)*
- `jq` — JSON parsing in YouTube API requests
- `curl` — YouTube API and thumbnail requests
- `nc` — mpv socket IPC (OpenBSD netcat or ncat; traditional/busybox nc lack unix-socket support and won't work)

The plugin's login page shows a health-check card for all of the above if anything is missing, stale, or unsupported.

## Usage

Add the bar widget to a bar and bind the widget actions (left click opens the
miniplayer, right click opens the full panel, middle click opens the plugin
settings). You can also toggle any entry with its IPC command:

```sh
noctalia msg panel-toggle aabidk20/yt-music:mini
noctalia msg panel-toggle aabidk20/yt-music:panel
```

The full panel groups everything: a home feed with Quick Picks, recommended
mixes and radios, and your library; playlist and queue views; and a search with
Top, Songs, and Playlists tabs. The miniplayer shows the current track with
play/pause, previous/next, shuffle, repeat, a seek scrubber, volume and mute,
like/unlike, and a hover tooltip with codec and bitrate info.

On first launch, sign in from the sidebar to extract your YouTube Music
cookies from an installed browser (Chrome, Chromium, Firefox, Edge, Brave,
Opera, Vivaldi, Whale, or Zen).

### Playback

Play any track, playlist, or search result; queue controls work across track,
playlist, and search indexes. Playback resumes after a restart via a saved
session. Audio is decoded via `yt-dlp`'s best-audio format; with a YouTube
Premium account you get the higher-quality 256 kbps Opus streams where
available.

### Offline

Download individual tracks or entire playlists for offline playback. Audio,
stream, thumbnail, and playlist caches are sized and clearable in Settings.

## Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `debug_logging` | `bool` | `false` | Write verbose logs to the plugin log file to help troubleshoot issues. |

## IPC

The service exposes actions via `noctalia msg` using the plugin state channel:

```sh
noctalia msg plugin aabidk20/yt-music:<entry-id> all <action> [payload]
```

The bar widget also opens entries directly (`panel-toggle aabidk20/yt-music:mini` and `aabidk20/yt-music:panel`).

## Notes

- **Network** — talks only to YouTube Music (`music.youtube.com`) and its
  thumbnail host (`i.ytimg.com`) via `curl`, `yt-dlp`, and the native HTTP
  API. No third-party servers.
- **Files** — cookies, playlists, sessions, quick picks, stats, and all audio /
  stream / thumbnail caches live under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/yt-music/`;
  transient scratch files and the mpv socket use `/tmp`.
- **Cookie extraction** — on sign-in the plugin reads your browser's YouTube
  cookies locally via `yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser` and stores them only in
  the cache directory above. Nothing is ever sent anywhere except directly to
  YouTube for playback and preference requests. See [Privacy](#privacy) below.
- **Processes** — spawns the tools listed in Requirements plus a browser on the
  sign-in page to authenticate.

### Debug log

With the `debug_logging` setting enabled, the plugin writes a `debug.log` to
the cache directory. It records actions and the IDs/names involved (track and
playlist titles, search queries, video and playlist IDs, download activity) to
help troubleshoot. Cookie values are never written to it. If you share the
`debug.log` when filing an issue, be aware it may contain the names of
playlists and tracks and other identifying activity; scrub anything private
before posting.

## Privacy

This plugin reads browser cookies locally on your machine to authenticate with
YouTube Music, and stores them only on disk in your user's cache directory.
Nothing is shared: no analytics, no telemetry, no external servers — cookies,
tokens, and stream URLs never leave your machine.
