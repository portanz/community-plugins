# SystemPulse

A bar widget that displays live CPU and RAM usage, with a detailed panel showing CPU, RAM, Disk, Network, and GPU monitoring. Clicking the widget toggles the panel.This plugin is meant to use via IPC only. That's why I did not work on the widget that much.

## Requirements

Requires `Nvtop` for detailed GPU telemetry (utilization, temperature, clock speeds, fan, power, VRAM, encoder/decoder). Without it, GPU monitoring falls back to basic values from `systemStats()`.

## Plugin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | `arrifat346afs/systempulse` |
| Entries | Bar widget: `sysmon`; panel: `panel`; shortcut: `toggle` |

## Usage

Add the `sysmon` widget from the Add-widget picker. Clicking the widget opens the system monitor panel, which attaches to the bar so its background follows the bar's `background_opacity`.

## Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `show_cpu` | `bool` | `true` | Display CPU usage percentage in the bar. |
| `show_ram` | `bool` | `true` | Display RAM usage percentage in the bar. |
| `show_gpu` | `bool` | `false` | Display GPU usage percentage in the bar. |
| `show_disk` | `bool` | `false` | Display Disk usage percentage in the bar. |
| `show_network` | `bool` | `false` | Display Network usage in the bar. |
| `panel_background_opacity` | `double` | `1.0` | Panel background translucency (0 transparent → 1 opaque); content stays opaque. Uses `fill = "surface/<alpha>"` so graphs, labels and cards remain fully opaque. Edited under Settings → Plugins (gear icon). |

## IPC

Toggle the panel from the shell:

```sh
noctalia msg panel-toggle arrifat346afs/systempulse:panel
```

To bind it to a Hyprland key in your `binds.lua`, define the command prefix once
and reuse it across keybinds:

```lua
-- Prefix for sending IPC messages; reuse for every SystemPulse binding.
local noctCall = "noctalia msg " -- trailing space keeps the command well-formed

hl.bind(
  "SUPER + SHIFT + S",
  hl.dsp.exec_cmd(noctCall .. "panel-toggle arrifat346afs/systempulse:panel"),
  { description = "Toggle SystemPulse panel" }
)
```

## Shortcut

Add the `toggle` shortcut from Settings → Control Center shortcuts to toggle the SystemPulse panel from the control center.

## Notes

- GPU monitoring uses `nvtop` when it is installed (queried periodically via
  `nvtop -s`), providing detailed data: utilization, temperature, clock speeds,
  fan speed, power draw, VRAM, and encoder/decoder usage.
- Without `nvtop`, the GPU monitor falls back to the basic `usagePercent` and
  temperature reported by the host's `systemStats()` API. These values are
  sparser and can be empty on some platforms, so installing `nvtop` is
  recommended for full GPU telemetry.
