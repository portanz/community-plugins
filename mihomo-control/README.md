# Mihomo Control

Monitor and control a Mihomo (Clash Meta) instance right from the Noctalia
bar: live traffic, proxy mode, proxy-group selection, latency tests and active
connections. It talks to the Mihomo external controller, which can run on this
machine (`127.0.0.1`) or on a remote host — just configure the IP, port and
secret.

## Plugin

| Field   | Value                       |
| ------- | --------------------------- |
| ID      | `mdj2812/mihomo-control`    |
| Entries | Bar widget: `widget`; panels: `panel`, `panel-attached`; service: `service`; shortcut: `mode` |

## Requirements

- Network access to the Mihomo external controller (local or remote)
- On `PATH` (declared in `plugin.toml` `dependencies`):
  - `jq` — project oversized `/connections` and `/proxies` API responses during polling

## Usage

Add the **Mihomo Control** widget from the Add-widget picker. By default it
shows the current proxy mode (rule / global / direct). **Widget label** can
instead show nothing, download speed, upload speed, both rates, or the active
connection count. It can also show the first visible proxy group's current
selection or its selected latency, falling back to that group's best known
member latency. Its size and color presentation are also configurable. Hover it
for the connection status, live download and upload rates, connection count and
each proxy group's current selection. Left-click the widget to toggle the
control panel using the configured **Panel placement**. Both variants can also
be opened directly:

```sh
noctalia msg panel-toggle mdj2812/mihomo-control:panel
noctalia msg panel-toggle mdj2812/mihomo-control:panel-attached
```

The first command opens the centered floating panel; the second opens the
variant attached to the bar.

The panel lets you switch the proxy mode (rule / global / direct), restart the
core, refresh the status, and manage every proxy group. Use the **Server**
dropdown to switch between saved controller profiles (host, port, secret, TLS).
**Manage** edits the active profile; profiles and per-server proxy-group order
are stored in the plugin data directory. Right-click the refresh button to
reload the whole plugin; left-click only re-polls the controller. Each group card
lists all of its members with their latency — sourced from mihomo's health
checks and refreshed by the group's **Test latency** button. Each card also
shows an overall latency (the selected member's, or the best tested one) right
in its subtitle, visible without expanding. Member lists are collapsed by
default; click a group header to expand it. Click a member to select it; the
current selection is marked with a dot. Use **Test all** next to the Proxy
groups heading to run a latency test on every group at once. Drag a card by
its ☰ grip over another card to reorder the groups. The nearest insertion gap
opens to preview the resulting layout before drop. The custom display order
survives controller polling and plugin restarts.

Add the **Mihomo: Rule** shortcut from Settings → Control Center shortcuts to
quickly toggle between rule and global mode.

Before the widget shows anything, enable the plugin's `service` entry — it owns
all communication with the external controller and streams the traffic data.

## Settings

| Setting             | Type    | Default      | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Host                | string  | `127.0.0.1`  | Hostname or IP of the Mihomo external controller.                           |
| Port                | string  | `9090`       | Port of the Mihomo external controller.                                     |
| Secret              | string  | *(empty)*    | `secret` from your Mihomo config; empty when authentication is disabled.    |
| HTTPS               | bool    | off          | Use `https://` (external-controller-tls or a TLS reverse proxy).            |
| Allow insecure TLS  | bool    | off          | Skip certificate verification for self-signed TLS controllers.              |
| Test URL            | string  | `https://www.gstatic.com/generate_204` | URL used for latency tests; empty uses each group's configured test URL. |
| Refresh interval    | int     | `2`          | Seconds between status polls (1–60); traffic rates stream in real time.     |
| Panel placement     | select  | `floating`   | Open the control panel centered on screen or attached to the bar widget.    |
| Widget label        | select  | `mode`       | Show nothing, mode, traffic, connections, or first-group proxy/latency.     |
| Icon size           | int     | `16`         | Bar icon size in pixels (10–32).                                            |
| Icon color mode     | select  | `status`     | Color the Mihomo glyph by connection status or use a custom color.          |
| Icon color          | color   | `primary`    | Color used by the tintable Mihomo glyph.                                    |

## IPC

The service exposes two IPC events for scripting and debugging:

```sh
noctalia msg plugin mdj2812/mihomo-control:service all refresh
noctalia msg plugin mdj2812/mihomo-control:service all cmd '{"op":"mode","mode":"global"}'
```

`refresh` re-polls version, config, connections and proxy groups. `cmd` accepts
the same command tables the panel sends (`mode`, `select`, `delay_test`,
`delay_test_all`, `reorder_group`, `restart`, `close_connections`, `refresh`,
`select_server`, `save_server`, `delete_server`).
`self-test` runs in-process checks for group ordering, traffic dedup helpers,
and watchdog interval setup; results are published to `mihomo.self_test`.

## Testing

Offline unit tests (plain Lua, no running shell required):

```sh
cd mihomo-control
lua5.4 tests/group_order_test.lua
noctalia plugins lint .
```

Full smoke test (adds live IPC when Noctalia is running):

```sh
./mihomo-control/tests/smoke.sh
```

Runtime self-test against the loaded service:

```sh
noctalia msg plugin mdj2812/mihomo-control:service all self-test
```

## Notes

- The plugin talks HTTP to the configured external controller and shells out to
  `jq` to project oversized `/connections` and `/proxies` responses so polling
  stays within Noctalia's Luau CPU budget. It also runs `noctalia msg plugins
  disable` / `enable` when the panel refresh button is right-clicked. It writes
  server profiles and per-server proxy-group display order (group names, never
  the secret) to its Noctalia plugin data directory. Reordering does not modify
  the Mihomo configuration.
- The bar widget uses a tintable glyph traced from the Clash cat silhouette. By
  default it is green online, amber while connecting and red offline; **Icon
  color mode** can instead apply one custom color. The panel keeps the official
  neutral logo next to its own status indicator.
- The traffic rate uses mihomo's streaming `GET /traffic` endpoint; status,
  connections and proxy groups are polled every refresh interval.
- The secret is stored in your Noctalia config and sent as the standard
  `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` header. It is sent in plain text unless
  HTTPS is enabled — use HTTPS for remote controllers.
- **Restart** posts to `/restart`, which re-executes the core; the plugin
  reconnects automatically once it is back. There is no API endpoint that
  stops the core — switching the mode to `direct` is the closest equivalent.
- A latency test where every node fails is reported as *all nodes timed out*:
  mihomo answers the delay endpoint with HTTP 504 in that case. If that keeps
  happening, set **Test URL** to an endpoint your network can reach.

## Development

- `service.luau` — headless API backend, publishes `mihomo.*` state.
- `group_logic.luau` — pure helpers for group ordering and traffic dedup (unit-tested).
- `widget.luau` — bar widget (rates + tooltip).
- `panel.luau` — control panel.
- `shortcut.luau` — rule/global mode toggle.
- `fonts/` — reviewable vector source and generated tintable Mihomo glyph font.
- `translations/` — user-facing strings.
